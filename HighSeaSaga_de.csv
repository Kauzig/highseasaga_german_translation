"#02250","Greetings!"
,"I've served <team> for 43 years, and now the king has ordered me to serve you."
,"Let's work together to bring glory to the name of <team>!"
,"Now, then... I understand that the king wants to see you."
,"Select the ""<co=0066cc>Throne Room</co>"" from the upper left of the map."
"#02251","Ah! You've come! I've heard so much about you."
,"I understand you will be in command of <team>'s fleet."
,"With your help, we'll make <team> the most powerful nation in the world!"
"#02252","...Ahem. There is one more thing."
,"Recently a group of pirates has been causing trouble nearby."
,"We just discovered the location of their <co=0066cc>hideout</co>. I need you to take care of them."
"#02253","But there's no need to go it alone..."
,"Take these medals. You can use them at the Tavern to recruit new crewmates."
"#02254","So...what are you waiting for? Go <co=0066cc>hire a crew </co>and take care of those pirates!"
,"You can now select the ""Tavern"" from the <co=0066cc>""Island"" menu</co>."
"#02255","You successfully defeated the pirates."
,"I will inform the king at once."
"#02256","Ho ho ho! I was observing the battle from the shadows!"
,"Very impressive. Very impressive indeed! Allow me to present you with one of our country's best ships."
,"Now go out there and show the world what <co=0066cc><team></co> is made of!"
"#02257","What a terrific ship!"
,"Let's get ready to set sail."
,"Tap the <co=0066cc>left key</co> to move inside your ship."
,"You'll need to <co=0066cc>build cabins</co> for the crewmates who will be sailing with you."
"#02258","Oh, I almost forgot."
,"You can build shops on <co=0066cc>vacant lots</co> on islands."
,"I look forward to hearing stories of your exploits!"
"#02259","Our intelligence agents have brought us some information about the surrounding area."
,"Why don't we try exploring a new area?"
"#02260","Oho!"
,"It seems that you've fulfilled some of the tasks that I set out for you."
,"Well done. Here is your reward."
"#02261","Oho!"
,"It seems that you've fulfilled some of the tasks that I set out for you."
,"Well done. Here is your reward."
"#02262","Ah! Could that smile mean... Yes!"
,"It seems that you've fulfilled some of the tasks that I set out for you."
,"Well done. Here is your reward."
"#02263","Hum de dum... ♪"
,"Oh, hello again!"
,"It seems that you've fulfilled some of the tasks that I set out for you."
,"Well done. Here is your reward."
"#02264","...Hm? Oh!"
,"It seems that you've fulfilled some of the tasks that I set out for you."
,"Well done. Here is your reward."
"#02265","I may have to pull another all-nighter to come up with more tasks for you."
,"Zzz..."
"#02266","Ho ho ho! I'm very impressed with your performance recently."
,"Now I can sleep soundly, knowing that our country is safe in your hands.<br>Zzz..."
"#02267","It's no exaggeration to say that you are the hero of <team>."
,"I'll no doubt be up all night trying to come up with a task to challenge you with."
,"Zzz..."
"#02268","If I were just a couple of years younger, I might join you out on the open sea..."
,"Just thinking about your adventures gets me all worked up!<br>Zzz..."
"#02269","It's time you moved up to a larger ship."
,"I've already called our craftsman. He should be here soon... Craftsman!"
"#02270","Here I am! Thank you for giving me this chance, Your Highness!"
,"I'd like to get started right away."
,"It'll be ready in two shakes of a bear's tail!"
,"Heh heh heh."
"#02271","Ah, it looks like your crew is ready."
,"Now allow me to demonstrate my lightning-fast shipbuilding skills!"
,"This will just take a moment!"
,"...Anybody seen the superglue? Oh, I suppose school glue will work in a pinch..."
"#02272","It's finished! Now you've got some more room to breathe!"
,"And now you can have <co=0066cc>one more combat team </co>as well!"
,"Try recruiting more crewmates to help you on your journey!"
,"Goodbye. I'm sure we'll meet again!"
"#02273","Das macht dann <1>x <0>. Danke."
,"Wenn du alles für die Verbesserung hast, können wir beginnen."
"#02274","Oh! Es sieht so aus, als hättest du alle benötigten Materialien."
,"Wir fangen sofort mit der Verbesserung an. Du wirst allerdings etwas warten müssen..."
"#02275","Wow! That was quite a battle!"
,"I got all hot and bothered just watching you fight! Oh, here comes the king!"
"#02276","That was... An amazing battle!"
,"I knew I was right about you! Here. Let me give you a glimpse of my list of tasks."
,"Have a good look!"
"#02277","Try to complete as many of the king's tasks as you can to earn rewards!"
,"...By the way, according to what one of the guards was saying, the pirates have a boss."
,"We got some information about more advanced quests."
"#02278","Say, it looks like someone dropped this during the battle."
"#02279","You got some <co=0066cc>food</co>! Food is indispensible for helping your crewmates develop."
,"Give it to a crewmate to help <co=0066cc>power them up</co>!"
,"It's an <co=0066cc>important source</co> of <co=ff0000>experience points</co>. Use it as much as you can."
,"Now, then. Let's get on with the quest."
"#02280","Thank you for your business."
,"We'll get right to work. It'll take around <co=0066cc><0></co>."
,"Why not kick back and relax for a bit?"
"#02281","...Come to think of it, I forgot to tell you something."
,"If you have <co=0066cc>a joiner who's not part of a combat team, </co>you can assign him or her to a construction project."
,"It can really cut down on your build time. Think it over."
,"Time to get to work! Right after I have a little snack..."
"#02282","Bearington Corporation is hard at work on the <0> construction project. Please wait for <1>."
"#02283","By the way..."
,"Bearington Corporation will keep working <co=0066cc>even when you're not playing the game."
,"So feel free to come back in a little while."
"#02284","Just when this job was getting interesting, I see that we've finished!"
,"I think this is some of the best work we've ever done. Use it well!"
,"Goodbye. I'm sure we'll meet again!"
,"Hey, why do we have all these extra parts left over? Eh, whatever..."
"#02285","Ah, you've got it at last, eh?"
,"Your reward this time is... Permission to expand your base!"
,"When you come back to the island from your next adventure, you'll find that the base has gotten a bit bigger."
,"Ho ho ho! Look forward to it!"
"#02286","Ah, you've returned."
,"There were a number of issues, but the base expansion we talked about is finally complete."
,"What are you going to do with all this extra space?"
,"I hope you'll keep working for the good of <team>."
"#02287","Ah, you've returned."
,"The island expansion is complete. I helped with the construction myself. I need the exercise."
,"Now I'm so ""swole"" that I won the arm wrestling tournament down at the tavern!"
,"You don't think they let me win, do you...? Anyway, enjoy!"
"#02288","Ah, you've returned."
,"With my new talent for construction, I decided to handle this expansion project all by myself."
,"I think I've found my true calling."
,"There's nothing I can't build with these two hands! Keep up the good work!"
"#02289","Ah, you've returned."
,"I'm afraid I pushed myself a little too hard with my last construction job..."
,"I've been bedridden for days... I guess you can't fight Father Time..."
,"Good luck in your adventures, but be careful not to overdo it..."
"#02290","You got a secret message from the king!"
"#02291","Hello."
,"My advisors have come up with some new tasks for you, so feel free to stop by the castle anytime."
,"I'll be waiting! Signed, The King"
"#02292","So, you're about to make your way out onto the wide open sea..."
,"Who knows what kinds of enemies and treasure await you? I sometimes wish I could go with you..."
,"Here. It's not much, but take this. Good luck!"
"#02293","Wow! We found something else!"
"#02294","You've completed all of the quests on this island!"
"#02295","Ho ho ho! I've been watching from the shadows."
,"It was worth the long trip out here."
,"Allow me to present you with this ""Medal of Conquest!"""
"#02296","Since you've conquered this island, you'll want to start exploring other areas."
,"Well done!"
"#02297","It's been a long journey but..."
,"We've conquered the strongest island there is!"
,"Even I, your humble assistant, can't believe we made it this far! We're the strongest fleet there is!"
,"We can keep traveling the world for as long as you like..."
,"Or you can purchase Replay Data at the Special Shop."
,"Anyway, carry on!"
"#02298","Our crew has really grown."
,"<co=0066cc>Crewmates not assigned to combat teams</co> can pick up treasure that falls on the deck, and..."
,"...Speaking of which, I forgot that the king gave us this."
"#02299","A lab is a very useful place that allows you to change treasure into<co=0066cc> more valuable items."
,"The crew has said that it's easier for them to use facilities <co=0066cc>on the same level as their cabin</co>."
,"You can try making new cabins on the <co=ff0000>lower level</co> as well."
"#02300","Look! We found something else while on that quest!"
"#02301","We've finished a number of quests at our base."
,"Why don't we try going to a <co=ff0000>different island</co>?"
,"<co=0066cc>Tap the left key...</co><br>And select an unexplored area from the world map!"
"#02302","It's nice to be back at home base. I missed it..."
,"The crew will visit the island to refill supplies, so try stopping back here if you're running low."
,"The king certainly seemed glad to see us."
,"We'll have to try our best to complete his tasks and earn more rewards!"
"#02303","I'd like to do some surveying to see if we can discover any new islands."
,"The party may be attacked by any number of enemies while surveying."
,"If all members of the party are defeated..."
,"...the survey mission will fail. So be sure you're prepared for combat."
"#02304","The party was defeated..."
,"We'll drop anchor until we get instructions from the ship."
,"You can try again <co=0066cc>after returning to base</co>."
"#02305","We have arrived at <0>."
"#02306","It's time to start surveying! Select the <co=0066cc>members who will participate in battle</co>!"
"#02307","It looks like there's a new island! Let's go check it out!"
"#02308","There's a new island there! And..."
,"There's also a <co=0066cc>suspicious-looking ship</co>! We'd better be prepared!"
"#02309","Huh..."
,"We performed the survey, but it looks like there's nowhere we can go here..."
,"Let's try surveying another area!"
"#02310","Huh..."
,"We performed the survey, but it looks like there are no islands here..."
,"But there is a suspicious-looking ship! We'd better be prepared!"
"#02311","The survey is complete."
"#02312","We just got more quest information."
"#02313","Wow! We just got information about a <co=ff0000>major quest</co>!"
"#02314","I'm getting a whiff of danger from this. We might want to <co=0066cc>visit other islands </co>before tackling it."
"#02315","Wow...!"
,"We just got some information about what might just be the ultimate quest!"
,"We'll have to really be ready before we tackle this one!"
"#02316","We just got some information about a new area of the sea."
,"Let's go check it out."
"#02317","Ho ho ho! Thanks to you, we've assembled quite an impressive fleet!"
,"I think it's time for <team> to start visiting some unexplored lands."
,"I'm so worked up thinking about the adventures you'll have that I won't sleep a wink tonight!"
,"Ho ho ho! Good luck! Zzz..."
"#02318","I've prepared a sea chart showing the surrounding area."
"#02319","You'll see that there are some unexplored areas."
,"Let's go survey them!"
"#02320","Ho ho ho..."
,"Now that you've amassed your forces, it's time you visited some other countries."
,"Go ahead and set sail for the great unknown!"
,"Just make sure you're ready first. Do you have a change of underwear...?"
"#02321","Thank goodness you came!"
,"I was lost and about to get captured!"
,"I'll be heading home now. Maybe we'll meet again."
"#02322","Thanks for your help earlier."
,"Please take this with my gratitude."
"#02323","You may find me plying my trade here and there. Maybe I can be of some help to you later."
,"Oh, and if you have a <co=0066cc>shop </co>on your ship, I might stop in to do a little shopping!"
,"Goodbye!"
"#02324","Thank goodness you came!"
,"There really are some bad people in this world!"
,"I'll be heading home now. Maybe we'll meet again."
"#02325","You may find me plying my trade here and there."
,"Maybe I can be of some help to you later."
,"Goodbye!"
"#02326","Oh, thank you!"
,"I just wanted to get some cakes for my grandchildren when I was surrounded by some scary people..."
,"The town was completely taken over."
,"But now there's a strong barricade in place, so I'll be going back to town. I'll see you later."
"#02327","Thanks for your help."
,"I'm afraid we ate the cakes... So you'll have to accept this with my thanks."
"#02328","If you're ever in trouble, try looking up at the night sky."
,"Looking up at a starry sky always helps calm my nerves."

"#02340","By the way, I plan to show off my new dumplings to all the kids in the neighborhood..."
,"And then eat them all myself!"

,"Here you go."
"#02354","Well, anyway... I've got to hurry off to the croquet grounds!"
,"You can read all about it in the paper tomorrow!"
,"Goodbye!"
"#02355","Oh, dear. It looks like you're running out of money."
,"The easiest way to get money is probably by <co=0066cc>defeating enemies in battle</co>."
,"But you'll also find it's easier to collect if you have many<co=0066cc> crewmates not assigned to combat teams</co>."
,"I think I have some change in my pocket, though... Let's see... No, that's a tissue..."
,"Ah, here we are. Go ahead and take it."
"#02356","It looks like your <co=0066cc>resources </co>are getting low. You need resources to perform various actions."
,"They're represented by the ""meat"" icon in the upper right, and decrease as your crew use the ship's facilities."
,"You can refill resources at island stores, so after a hard day of questing, return to base and recharge."
,"I think there's a little left in my cabin you could have... Let's see... I think it's in my spare boots..."
,"Ah, here we are. Go ahead and take it."
"#02357","You don't seem to have any crewmates on board..."
,"In addition to the ones assigned to combat teams, you also need <co=ff0000>crew to stay on the ship</co>."
,"They pick up items off the deck, research them, and watch over the ship while the others are gone."
,"Try and recruit some more crewmates!"
"#02358","You've got some new crewmates!"
,"If you want them to fight in battle, assign them to a combat team under ""<co=0066cc>Combat Teams</co>"" in the menu."
,"You're getting the hang of it. Keep <co=ff0000>adding crewmates</co> and completing <co=0066cc>quests</co>!"
"#02359","One of your crewmates has leveled up enough to <co=0066cc>master a job</co>!"
,"They've learned a <co=0066cc>special skill</co>. They can use it even if they change to another job."
,"In fact, it might not be a bad time to select a new job for them!"
,"...Oh, I guess I forgot to tell you."
"#02360","Changing a crewmate's job requires various types of knowledge."
,"Normally, crewmates earn knowledge a bit at a time <co=0066cc>when using your ship's facilities."
,"But if you have a special book, you can change jobs right away."
,"They're very rare, but they can come in handy when you don't have enough knowledge."
"#02361","Ah, it looks like it hatched without any problems. Let me give you this to help raise it on the ship."
"#02362","I can't wait to see what kind of monster it is."
,"So feel free to stop by the nearest monster farm."
,"Any monster farm in the world will look after your monsters for you!"
,"We'll be waiting!"
"#02363","What's this? <0> doesn't seem very energetic for some reason."
,"And there's no sign of any monsters in this area."
,"The villagers don't even feel like coming out of their houses."
,"They should recover if we go to another island or if you don't play the game for a while."
,"So let's head for another island!"
"#02364","If you've got a smith ticket, be sure and speak up!"
"#02365","Here you can install cannons on the deck of your ship."
,"I've heard they're used in online battles that you can play if you reach Rank 20 or above..."
,"Try saving up to get a good one!"
"#02366","Ooh! You've reached rank 20!"
,"From this point on, you'll be able to have battles with ships from all over the world."
,"Fighting battles can be very rewarding for both people involved!"
,"So from now on, if you see another player's ship on the <co=0066cc>world map</co>, try battling them!"
"#02367","Welcome back."
,"During your last online battle, you were <co=ff0000>disconnected</co>..."
,"That means that you lost... Be sure to fight your battles to the very end."
,"But let's not worry about that! Why don't we do a little questing?"
"#02368","Oh, it looks like you don't have enough <co=0066cc>stamina</co>."
,"Stamina regenerates in real time! So playing a little bit each day might not be a bad idea."
,"But if you find yourself really wanting to play a lot, you can refill your stamina at my shop!"
,"Feel free to stop by."
"#02369","A little low on <co=0066cc>stamina</co>, are we? Well, let's take care of that!"
"#02370","<team> has gotten quite strong!"
,"Maybe we should try going back to the <co=0066cc>king's castle</co>."
,"Who knows what new discoveries might await us?"
"#02371","Speaking of which...! Our country's fleet is now quite powerful..."
,"And that means that we're starting to get a lot of requests for help from other countries."
,"It can be dangerous, but if you feel like visiting another country, just come to me."
,"I'll just be here polishing my crown..."
"#02372","Oh, dear... It looks like you're running low on medals."
,"You can get medals by completing a lot of quests, or by making sure to play the game every day."
,"I've also heard that once you and your friends reach <co=0066cc>fleet rank 20</co>, it gets easier to earn medals..."
,"But I think I had a medal or two in my pocket... Let me see... No, that's a toothbrush..."
,"Ah, here we are. Go ahead and take it."
"#02373","I knew all of that battling would pay off!"
,"Our<co=0066cc> fleet rank </co>has gone up! Defeating enemies and monsters makes your rank gauge go up."
,"Your <co=0066cc>maximum stamina </co>will go up for every 3 ranks you achieve, which will let you visit more places."
,"<co=ff0000>..."
,"I really should've mentioned this earlier, but be sure and use the menu to <co=0066cc>save </co>your game periodically."
,"Oh, I'll slip in an auto-save once in a while, but remember to <co=ff0000>save your game before you stop playing</co>."
,"Now that we have that out of the way, let's get back to adventuring!"
"#02374","Hmm. We seem to have discovered a rather large egg."
,"The boys in the lab can't seem to make heads or tails out of it."
,"I guess we'll just leave it in the ship's hold..."
"#02375","Wait a minute!"
,"That egg..."
,"I'll have to look into this in more detail to be sure, but I think it may be a <co=ff0000>monster egg</co>!"
,"We'd better head to the nearest monster farm to check this out!"
"#02376","Ho ho ho. By the way..."
,"Is the <co=ff0000>maximum level of your island facilities</co> high enough?"
,"I was in the royal library the other day and I found a book about how to raise that level."
,"Maybe it can be of some use to you..."
"#02377","So the king had this the whole time?"
,"We can use it to increase the level of our island facilities."
,"It does cost money, but higher level facilities should produce better products!"
"#02378","It looks like the island's facilities have reached the maximum level!"
,"It seems like there should be a way to increase it even more, but..."
,"I'm afraid I have no idea what it could be... Maybe if we keep adventuring we'll discover it!"
"#02379","That crewmate is leaving us. But I'm sure they'll be happy somewhere in <team>."
"#02380","I guess we have to withdraw and leave the treasure chests behind..."
,"But if we train somewhere, I'm sure we'll be able to win later!"
"#02381","You don't have enough money..."
"#02382","Your fleet rank isn't high enough..."
"#02383","You don't have any empty skill slots."
"#02384","You haven't learned any skills."
"#02385","Orders changed."
"#02386","So we're setting sail at last! Smell that sea air! Feel those waves! This is so exciting!"
,"On the high seas, you never know when you'll be attacked! Make sure you've selected good combat members!"
,"By the way... Did you know that your ship keeps sailing even when you're not playing the game?"
,"True story. Anyway... Let's go!"
"#02387","Uh-oh... The entire party was defeated..."
,"But not to worry! If you use a medal, <co=0066cc>you can restart right where you left off</co>, with full health!"
,"If you choose to withdraw, any treasure that you collected up that point will be lost, so be careful."
,"You can always try to level up your crewmates somewhere else and come back later."
"#02388","Hm? That crewmate's equipment looks pretty heavy."
,"They can still go to battle, but they'll walk slowly. You might try selecting something else."
,"You might also try tapping the ""Suggest"" button (the left key)."
"#02389","Uh-oh."
,"The ship's <co=ff0000>hold</co> is full..."
,"To build a new hold, you'll need to get one of the king's rewards."
,"Increase the number of <co=ff0000>onboard crewmates</co> to <co=ff0000>research</co> a lot of treasure and keep the holds clear."
"#02390","Uh-oh."
,"The ship's <co=ff0000>brig</co> is full..."
,"If you don't have enough room in the brig, prisoners will be released and you won't get their bounties."
,"You'd better <co=ff0000>head back to base</co> soon to make room in the brig."
"#02391","Ack! Enemies are on deck!"
,"It looks like the combat team heard the alarm and is on its way to take care of the intruders!"
,"Let's watch the battle!"
"#02392","The <co=0066cc>comfort </co>level of your ship's facilities has gotten quite high."
,"A higher comfort helps injured crewmates to heal more quickly, allowing them to return to duty."
,"You want the crewmates who go into battle to live in comfort, right?"
"#02393","Our crew has been growing by leaps and bounds. In fact, we're full up!"
,"If you want to add any more crewmates from now on, you'll have to dismiss a current member."
,"You can open the menu and scroll down to select ""Dismiss"" at any time."
,"I wonder if one of the king's rewards might allow us to get a bigger ship...?"
"#02394","Uh-oh. You have some facilities on-board that can't be accessed."
,"If you <co=0066cc>place facilities too close together</co>, there won't be any place for the crew to walk."
,"Why don't you try moving or removing some facilities?"
"#02395","Welcome! Have an egg? You've come to the right place!"
"#02396","The egg has been placed. Next, you need to help it develop."
,"<co=ff0000>Tap the egg again</co> and try using items or equipment on it to discover new types of monsters!"
"#02397","It looks like the egg is hatching!"
,"I wonder what kind of monster it'll turn out to be!"
"#02398","Come back again if you find more eggs!"
"#02399","Welcome. I'd be happy to upgrade your equipment."
"#02400","What equipment would you like to upgrade?"
"#02401","Next, select <co=0066cc>a material item to use</co> in the upgrade."
"#02402","Success! What else would you like to upgrade?"
"#02403","Come again!"
"#02404","Welcome to my shop."
"#02405","Oh, hello."
"#02406","You can use this screen to build facilities aboard your ship."
,"First, you'll probably want to<co=0066cc> build some cabins </co>for your crewmates to sleep in."
"#02407","Here you can give your crewmates equipment that is useful in battle."
,"You can get equipment on quests or buy it on islands that you happen to visit."
,"Why don't you try equipping something now?"
"#02408","Here you can boost your crewmates' abilities using power-up items."
,"Powering up crewmates will help them level up and eventually master their jobs!"
"#02409","Here you can select the crewmates you want to go into battle."
,"Using various crewmates, including some with ranged weapons, can help you complete quests."
"#02410","Select the team leader. You'll probably want to choose someone with <co=0066cc>a lot of stars</co>."
"#02411","Here you can change a crewmate's job."
,"Changing jobs requires <co=0066cc>knowledge</co>, which crewmates acquire when using onboard facilities."
,"If you develop your ship, you may end up discovering some new jobs."
"#02412","Here, you can dismiss a crewmate you no longer need."
,"You can do this when your ship is full and you absolutely must hire a new crewmate."
"#02413","Here you can select skills for your crewmates!"
,"Skills not only help out in battle, they can also affect activities aboard the ship."
,"When a crewmate reaches their maximum job level, I understand they can learn a lot of skills!"
"#02414","Here you can view all of the relics you've worked so hard to obtain."
,"You may find yourself overcome by emotion, so don't be afraid to weep openly..."
,"I understand that some relics can even be upgraded to improve their effects."
"#02415","Here you can give orders to all of your crew about what to do aboard ship."
,"Select ""All"" to give <co=0066cc>the same order to the entire crew</co>."
,"Select ""Free"" to have your crew act on their individual orders."
,"Choose the best option for the situation."
"#02416","Here is your chance to earn a lot of medals!"
,"From what I hear, if you install certain games, then restart this game and return to this screen..."
,"You'll get medals!"
,"You might want to try it out with a free game first."
"#02417","Here you can select a duty for your crew to perform aboard the ship."
,"The duties you select will be <co=0066cc>given priority </co>over other duties."
,"Just remember: selecting all of them will have no effect."
"#02418","We can finally visit another country!"
,"Go ahead and select the country you want to visit. You can scroll horizontally."
"#02419","Well, now..."
,"It seems that an island resident was so pleased with one of the ship's shops they sent a thank-you gift."
,"You can check satisfaction using the shop meters on the island's info screen. The types of meters vary from shop to shop."
,"You might want to stay a bit and do some shopping yourself."
"#02420","We're not quite strong enough to visit another country yet."
,"You can get stronger by bringing prisoners back to base or building island facilities."
"#02421","Need to build in a vacant lot? Leave it to Bearington Corporation!"
,"What would you like to build?"
"#02422","Insufficient knowledge to change jobs."
,"Crewmates get knowledge when using <co=0066cc>onboard facilities</co>."
"#02423","You've used your maximum number of retries, so you'll have to withdraw..."
,"Try coming back later after you've toughened up the crew up with some quests somewhere else."
"#02424","The online battle is complete. The registered data for our ship's quest team has also been updated."
,"Let's hope our registered data challenges many rivals to battle!"
,"Let's keep training and facing as many enemy fleets as possible!"
"#02425","You can now <co=ff0000>send more teams on quests</co>!"
,"Select a team and then choose its members."
"#02426","On this campaign screen, you can work with friends to try and defeat certain monsters..."
,"And earn some<co=0066cc> fabulous prizes </co>for your trouble!"
,"Sometimes monsters can be hard to find..."
,"But try to defeat as many as possible to win prizes!"
"#02427","Aha! Trying an online battle at last, eh?"
,"Battles are fought automatically between each player's quest teams."
,"<co=0066cc>Installing cannons</co> and having <co=ff0000>snipers</co> can be very important, so be sure you're prepared."
,"Win at least 5 times in the week before Monday and your online rank will go up. You may even get a prize."
,"You can fight players from all over, so get out there and win!"
"#02428","Ah, a friend battle, eh?"
,"Fighting with your friends allows them to get medals, so they should be happy to fight once each day!"
"#02429","<co=0066cc>Replay Data </co>has been created using your current game data!"
,"Tap ""Start"" on the title screen and then select ""Replay."""
"#02430","This is a chat area."
,"It is a service provided by Lobi, which is separate from this game."
,"You can try using it to recruit friends or if you have a question about the game."
,"Please remember to be polite and considerate during chat."
,"Also keep in mind that if you change your Lobi nickname, the change <co=ff0000>won't be reflected</co> in the game."
,"See you later!"
"#02431","About those skill slots that you were running low on earlier..."
,"It seems that crewmates with more stars can have more skills assigned to them."
,"Use care when assigning skills."
"#02432","If you get many jobs to their maximum level, you'll be able to learn the skill you couldn't learn earlier."
,"So try to increase the levels of your combat team members and change jobs frequently."
"#02433","Ein feindliches Schiff verfolgt uns!"
,"Bereitmachen für die Schlacht!"
"#02434","Das war eine atemberaubende Schlacht!"
,"Wir konnten ein paar Schätze vom feindlichen Schiff bergen!"
"#02435","Hee hee. I hear y'all met my li'l brother the other day."
,"Well, I'm afraid this is MY territory. I can't let y'all pass."
,"Just a word of warnin': I'm way stronger'n my brother!"
"#02436","You really think you have what it takes..."
,"To squabble with Squidos?!"
"#02437","Grrr! I'm so cranky! Really irritated... You might even say..."
,"Crabby! (Didn't see that one coming, did you?)"
"#02438","We won't let you set one foot in our territory!"
,"Prepare for combat!"
"#02439","Hi, there! You know, there are a lot of sunken ships in these parts."
,"You should be careful."
,"Because we're the ones who sunk them!"
"#02440","Oh! I didn't expect to see a ship around here!"
,"Look at those sails! So impressive! So majestic! I'd love to have a ship like that someday!"
,"<co=ff0000>..."
,"Actually, I think I'll just take yours!"
"#02441","Oho! So an enemy country has decided to enter our territory."
,"Enjoy the breaths you take now..."
,"For they shall be your last!"
"#02442","I hear you made some trouble for my friends the other day."
,"Those poor Squidos had to have casts on all ten legs!"
,"So you can imagine what I'm going to do to you in return!"
"#02443","Heh."
,"Just when I think my time machine has brought me to a safe time period, I get<br>involved in more fighting."
,"Very well... Say hello to Davy Jones for me!"
"#02444","This is our territory! Only beings with slimy sinuous bodies like ours can pass! Get lost!"
,"...You're not moving!"
,"Very well then, we'll wrap our bodies all around you! Soon you'll appreciate our sliminess!"
"#02445","Cheep, cheep! We won't be beat!"
"#02446","Hello, there. Everybody's been talking about this band of pirates from a faraway country."
,"It seems they've been conquering a lot of territory. Have you seen them?"
,"...It's you, isn't it?"
,"Very well, then... I have no choice..."
,"But to ask you for your autograph!"
"#02447","It must've taken courage to face me. Tell you what. I'll only fight with 70% of my normal strength today."
,"Or...60%? How about we split the difference and go with 65%?"
,"Anyway...!"
,"Prepare yourselves!"
"#02448","Ah, you must be the band of merry pirates I've heard so much about!"
,"Well, I'm afraid you've met your match! You'll leave if you know what's good for you!"
,"Seriously...leave!"
"#02449","I'm impressed you made it this far! But I'm afraid your adventure ends here!"
,"Tonight you sleep with the fishes!"
"#02450","Slurp!"
,"That ship looks tasty!"
,"I'll take it!"
"#02451","Greetings! We spent many a long year building up this country..."
,"So I'm afraid you'll have to be the first visitors we won't be welcoming with open arms!"
,"Prepare for battle!"
"#02452","Grrr! I'm so cranky! Really irritated... You might even say..."
,"Angry! ...What? Just because I'm a crab I have to make some stupid pun?"
"#02453","Grrr! Someone stole our precious pearls..."
,"Was it you?!"
,"No? Really? You're sure? Well, this is embarrassing..."
,"But considering I got the lads out of bed and all, we'll have to go ahead with the battle!"
"#02454","Ah, I was just getting tired of working on my invisibility skills."
,"So why don't you help me practice my swordsmanship?"
"#02455","Bouncy! Bouncy!"
,"Wanna bounce with me? Huh? Huh? Do ya?"
,"Come on! It's fun!"
"#02456","I have found the dark lord at last!"
,"My quest to free the cursed princess and win her hand has been a long one to be sure..."
,"But that will only make my victory all the sweeter!"
"#02457","I've been working on my slithering technique."
,"Here, let me show you..."
,"By wrapping myself around your neck!"
"#02458","I may be a fairy, but I've always been a bit of a nonconformist."
,"I want to be able to go back to fairyland as a conquering hero, with my head held high."
,"So..."
,"Would you mind losing?"
"#02459","Hello. I am the monarch of these lands. In other words, I'm king."
,"I've decided the best way to expand my kingdom and ensure its safety is for me to lead my fleet myself."
,"But enough with the pleasantries..."
,"Let's fight!"
"#02460","Hey! I thought you were fellow turtles, but, now that I look closely, you have no shells or scaly skin!"
,"Hmph! How dare you pretend to be turtles!"
"#02461","It's been quite a while since I've had a bite to eat. 62 years, as a matter of fact..."
,"I think I'm due for a snack...!"
"#02462","Hi! I'm promoting a new strength tonic. It's super effective! ...At least that's what they say."
,"If I could beat an infamous group of pirates like yourselves..."
,"I'm sure it would start flying off the shelves!"
,"So let's get this over with!"
"#02463","Hisssss!"
,"You'll get my action figure collection when you pry it from my cold, dead coils!"
,"Just try it! I'll sssswallow you whole!"
"#02464","Grrr! Humans!"
,"I'll eat you tail first!"
"#02465","ALERT! ALERT!"
,"INTRUDERS!"
,"ELIMINATE!"
"#02466","ALERT! ALERT!"
,"NO ENTRY!"
,"OFF LIMITS!"
"#02467","Hello. I'm on a world cruise at the moment."
,"While I was visiting so many pristine islands and enjoying these beautiful vistas, it came to me."
,"I was born to be a pirate!"
,"So let's fight!"
"#02468","ALERT! ALERT!"
,"INTRUDERS!"
,"EXTERMINATE!"
"#02469","Heh! So you're the group of pirates that everyone is talking about!"
,"Let's see how you handle my legendary sword-fighting technique!"
"#02470","Hey, hey! Wanna fight? I'll warn you: I've got superhuman strength."
,"One of my headbutts will knock you into the middle of next week!"
"#02471","Mew, mew..."
,"(""Oh, look! Food!"")"
"#02472","Hello. I am a rare creature made entirely of cardboard boxes."
,"You should be aware that I am an endangered species."
"#02473","Mew, mew, mew..."
,"(""Look! More food!"")"
"#02474","Well, if it isn't the pirates who have been causing trouble in our territory!"
,"Prepare to die!"
"#02475","Greetings, knave!"
,"Prepare to die!"

,"You'd better watch your sodium intake! ...Because of all the salt water you'll be swallowing...?"
"#02483","Heh heh. Hello again."
,"The body you destroyed the other day has been fully repaired."
,"Now, then..."
,"Can't you just let me win one?"
"#02484","Heh heh. Hello again."

,"Now, then..."
,"The sea... Yadda, yadda... Your doom... Yadda, yadda... You get the idea."
"#02485","Ah..."
,"What a lovely day..."
,"We should really go for a picnic instead of sticking around on guard duty."
,"...?!"
,"It's an enemy!"
"#02486","So you're the ones the king sent, eh?"
,"Our last 73 battles have ended in ties..."
,"You really think you can beat us?!"
"#02487","We're not as weak as you think!"
,"Come and fight!"
"#02488","Ha! You think you can stand up to a fisherman?"
,"I'll have you filleted in no time flat!"
"#02489","Hello! I'm an adventurer traveling the unexplored corners of the world!"
,"I got lost and was about to run out of food!"
,"So I'm going to have to steal yours!"
"#02490","Ho! Ha! These fists are lethal weapons!"
,"None can stand up to them! Come and see!"
"#02491","Ha ha ha! With this sword, I have defeated countless fiends."
,"Seriously, I tried counting and totally lost track!"
,"Let's see how you like my blade!"

"#02493","Oh, hello."
,"Are you <co=0066cc>equipping </co>your crewmates properly?"
,"Equipment can make a big difference in your battles. You'll want to make sure your crew has the best."
,"......?!"
,"Wait a minute! You're the enemy!"
"#02494","Well, I'll be! I didn't expect anybody to make it all the way out here!"
,"That takes guts! Don't mean that I won't kill ya, though!"

,"But I'm afraid I can't give you any autographs!"
"#02498","Have you come to taste the sting of my arrows?"
,"Then, by all means, allow me to pick you off from a safe distance!"
"#02499","Hey-hey!"
,"I got separated from my traveling circus a long time ago."
,"So I started pirating. Gimme your money!"

,"Are you paying attention to your ship's construction?"
,"Placing compatible facilities near your crew's cabins makes it easier for them to earn <co=0066cc>knowledge </co>points."
,"And that helps them change jobs. Try tapping a cabin to check its compatibility occasionally!"
,"<co=ff0000>..."
,"Wait a minute! You're the enemy!"
"#02503","Ya! Ya! Time to put all those years of spear training to the test!"
,"Ya! Ya!"
"#02504","Ha ha ha! Welcome, pirates!"
,"Think you can stand up to my attacks?"
"#02505","Yay! Yay!"
,"Yesterday I started holding my spear in a different way, and it makes a huge difference!"
,"I can't wait to try it on you guys!"

,"Pick you off from afar!"
"#02512","Ha ha ha! I'll have to admit, I'm surprised anybody made it this far!"
,"I just got a new weapon that I'm dying to try out."
,"Brace yourselves... BAM!"

,"Is your ship's brig gettin' a bit full? Try stopping at your base once in a while to empty it out!"
,"I've heard that one of the king's rewards might be the ability to build more brigs, ya know..."
,"So try and capture as many enemies as you can to build up your population!"

,"Ha ha ha! Come on and fight!"
"#02527","Hello, there. You've certainly come a long way."
,"You know, I was a king until just recently..."
,"But I got chased off the throne for breaking the rule about only playing one hour of games each day."
,"I've been living off of my oil wells, but wouldn't you know it? I've still got too much darn money!"
,"So I thought I'd try piracy to pass the time. You'll be my first real battle! How fun!"

,"That's why I'm a wizard."
,"It's no exaggeration to say that there's no monster that I can't train."
,"Why, yesterday I managed to capture 2 out of 5 monsters without getting bitten. That takes skill!"
,"So... Are we going to fight or what?"
"#02532","This is quite a crew you have here!"
,"But I'll take you all on!"

,"Making people laugh is my mission in life!"
,"I devoted my every waking moment to studying humor, but it still wasn't enough!"
,"So naturally, I decided to become a pirate! ...Look, don't over-think this."

"#02537","Heh. I represent a retail company that sells all across the seven seas."

,"We'll have to do something about that!"

,"People! I've gotta get outta here!"

,"Are you upgrading your weapons and armor at the blacksmith?"
,"It's very important if you want to get the most power out of your weapons!"

,"Hm? Oh, yeah, I guess we should fight."
"#02594","Hey, there. You lost?"
,"You poor lost little goat. Here, I'll lead you home."
"#02595","Hello."
,"Have you had much luck hatching monster eggs?"
,"From what I can tell, egg values have different limits depending on their rank."
,"A rank 1 egg has max values of 100, but it seems that some monsters won't appear if you make them exactly 100."
,"Egg hatching is surprisingly deep. You may want to try a variety of approaches."
,"Now let's fight."

,"Sh! Quiet!"
,"I'm in the middle of a new anti-pirate spell!"

,"Let's see what I can do to thank you..."
,"In battle!"
"#02599","Ha!"
,"Now that I've inherited my country's super-secret spear techniques..."
,"There's no one in the world who can beat me! En garde!"
"#02600","All right. Time to show off my elite skills!"
"#02601","Oho! So you're the pirates who've been causing so much trouble!"
,"Let's see how you handle a genuine, bona fide, in-the-flesh Viking!"
"#02602","Aha...! You seem to have what it takes to commune with monsters."
,"If you have some monsters in your crew, I assume you're working on leveling them up?"
,"When they reach a certain level, they can <co=0066cc>evolve </co>into even stronger forms. But you knew that..."
,"Of course in some cases they can even get weaker, or not evolve at all. It just depends..."
,"Well, come on. Let's see how strong these monsters of yours are!"
"#02603","Hello. I'm a kappa--you know, a water sprite? I'm originally from a river, but I'm moving up in the world..."
,"Yep, it's nothing but ocean for me from now on!"
"#02604","So, we meet again."
,"I almost never meet people more than once..."
,"It must be fate!"
,"...By which I mean that I'm fated to kill you!"
"#02605","<co=ff0000>..."
,"You think you can get in the way of a ninja?"
,"Don't you know that ninjas are experts..."
,"...at making things disappear?!"
"#02606","Jump, jump! Jumpety-jump!"
,"...I WILL DESTROY YOU!"
"#02607","Heh."
,"I hope you don't think that I'm just an ordinary mariner!"
,"Underestimate me at your peril!"
"#02608","The other sailors speak of pirates who can kill you with a glance! Is that you?"
,"Oh, no! I'm so scared! Ha!"
"#02609","Whoa! I didn't expect to run into a gang of super-strong pirates here!"
,"My favorite singer is signing autographs tomorrow!"
,"You're not gonna make me miss it!"
"#02610","Oh! I thought I heard some scary sounding footsteps! So it was you pirates, eh?"
,"Well, I'm gonna go see my favorite singer in concert tomorrow!"
,"You're not gonna make me miss it!"
"#02611","Drip, drip! Hello, there!"
,"How are you? Do you ever make mistakes? You know, faux pas?"
,"Just the other day, I was the entertainment at my cousin's wedding, but I made a huge mess of it..."
,"I was so embarrassed that I wet myself..."
,"But I won't make a mistake today!"
"#02612","Welcome? What can I get for you today?"
,"Oops! Hello. I'll be your secretary here and I'll do whatever I can to help you make a best-selling game!"
,"Oops again! This is not a game company at all! But...that does sound like it would make a fun game, no?"
,"So... Are we going to fight or what?"
"#02613","The produce I grow in my fields is second to none!"
,"After all, I got plenty of practice with that Pocket Harvest game!"
,"I'm warning you, now. I don't let anybody mess up my fields!"
"#02614","Hello! I'm quite a savvy merchant, if I do say so myself!"
,"I learned everything I know by playing company management simulation games!"
,"I can't recall the name of the company that made them... Silosoft? Kilosoft? Anyway..."
,"If you beat me... Maybe you should try one of those other games!"
"#02615","Hmph!"
,"Y-You wanna fight?!"
"#02616","So we meet again."
,"Many pirates have sought the legendary treasure, but most ended up at the bottom of the sea."
,"How do I know?"
,"Because we're the ones who sunk them!"
"#02617","As a blacksmith, I've produced countless weapons..."
,"Works of art that I poured my very soul into... I've always regretted having to sell them."
,"That's why I've decided to leave on a journey to take them all back!"
,"And I'm starting with yours!"
"#02618","Well, now! I didn't expect the strongest pirates in the world to make it into this neck of the woods!"
,"Just give me a minute while I get ready for battle! Almost there..."
,"OK! Let's do this!"
"#02619","Look at these biceps!"
,"That's what carpentry will do for you!"
,"And they're pretty useful in combat as well!"
"#02620","So you're the legendary pirates I've heard so much about..."
,"If I defeat you, I can become a legend myself!"
"#02621","*crackle, crackle*"
,"I love watching fire burn... But I can't actually make fire so I'll have to fight you hand-to-hand!"
"#02622","Who do you think you are?!"
,"Do you really think you can beat us? We've tied our last 91 battles!"
,"We'll beat you to a pulp!"
"#02623","Hmph!"
,"I can't let anyone stand in the way of my quest for world domination!"
"#02624","Ha ha ha! I am a world-class pugilist! You really think you can beat me?"
,"...No, I can't draw you a picture! I'm not that kind of artist! Why does everyone ask me that...?"
,"Prepare to face the ultimate in martial skill!"
"#02625","Wa ha ha ha ha!"
,"I haven't seen an outsider in so long. It's kind of nice..."
,"Now give me all of your money and treasure! ...And food if you have any!"
"#02626","Oh!"
,"You found me!"
"#02627","Wow! I didn't expect any pirates to come all the way here to capture me!"
,"But this is one bounty you're not going to collect!"
"#02628","Hmm... I'm surprised you little lost sheep managed to make it all the way here."
,"But now that you're here, I guess I'd better shear you. Your wool would make a lovely sweater!"
,"Seriously, take off that costume and hand it over!"
"#02629","That's far enough!"
,"If you want to go any further..."
,"You'll have to make it past me!"
,"Well, me and these guys next to me. It's a group effort, really..."
,"Let's get 'em, boys!"
"#02630","Oh, hello!"
,"The boss? Oh, he's resting just over there."
,"Go on. You can't miss him!"
,"<co=ff0000>..."
,"Gotcha! I'm the boss!"
,"Eat this!"
"#02631","*cough, cough*"
,"I'm a little under the weather. I think I'm coming down with something..."
,"But I'll do my best!"
"#02632","You there! Where do you think you're going?"
,"Ah, I see..."
,"Well, then, allow me to show you the way."
,"The way to hell, that is!"
"#02633","Hmm...!"
,"Can you give me just a bit more time?"
,"I'm about to finish the best invention of my career..."
,"Almost there..."
,"Agh! Now it's ruined!"
,"And it's all your fault for distracting me!"
"#02634","Ha ha! More fools have come to fight me again today!"
,"Very well, I'll finish you off and then have a little snack!"
"#02635","Arr! Greetings!"
,"Ye seen any pirates in these parts?"
,"Ha ha! Ye mean ye be pirates?! Dressed like that?!"
,"THIS be what a REAL pirate looks like!"
"#02636","Zzz..."
,"Wha--?!"
,"Who dares interrupt my nap?!"
,"I'll see that you sleep...forever!"
"#02637","Hiya!"
,"You certainly look ready to fight. That's the spear-it!"
,"What? I thought it was funny... What with me being a spearman and all..."
"#02638","What?! How did you cross my magical boundary?!"
,"This kind of thing hasn't happened since those legendary pirates attacked..."
,"Hey, wait a minute..."
,"Was that you?! Now I'm really mad!"
"#02639","Ha ha ha!"
,"Ha ha ha haaaaa! *wheeze*"
,"I can't breathe in this mask!"
,"Let's get this over with, quick!"
"#02640","Grrr! Those stupid pirates are all anybody can talk about!"
,"Just because they've defeated one skilled warrior after another..."
,"It doesn't mean they're all that. I could beat them, don't you think?"
,"Hm? You mean you're them?!"
,"How embarrassing... But in my defense I only got 6 hours of sleep last night!"
"#02641","*crackle, crackle*"
,"Prepare to die!"
"#02642","How are we feeling today? No aches or pains?"
,"No injuries of any kind?"
,"...Good."
,"Now I can fight you in good conscience!"
"#02643","Ha ha ha ha ha! Welcome!"
,"This should be quite a battle. I'm looking forward to it!"
"#02644","HO HO HO!"
,"TIME FOR YOU..."
,"TO GO!"
,"...By which I mean, go to the underworld. To die, in other words. Sorry if that wasn't clear..."
"#02645","Heh. Care to bet your life savings on the outcome of this battle?"
,"I didn't think so."
,"Some people just don't have the guts."
,"But I'll fight you anyway!"
"#02646","It's time for battle!"
,"Well, I guess that's obvious, what with all the weapons and armor..."
"#02647","Heh... Who would've thought that a little nothing of a country like <team>..."
,"Could become one of the major powers in this world?"
,"And at the center of it all..."
,"Is none other than Mr. Fluff E. Sheep! I'll kill him first!"
"#02648","Burn, burn, burn!"
,"I'll set fire to that ship of yours and use it to roast marshmallows!"
"#02649","Well, now..."
,"You've discovered an impressive number of islands."
,"I've been watching you from the very beginning."
,"You see, I've been a stowaway on your ship the whole time!"
,"I've just been waiting for the moment when I could defeat you and take it for myself!"
"#02650","I can fight, too, you know!"
,"Look! I'll show you!"
"#02651","...If you continue on in this direction..."
,"You should see an island... Hm? It's not there. That's odd..."
,"Hey! This is my path! You can't stand on my path!"
"#02652","I certainly didn't expect to run into a worthy opponent out here."
,"I hear you've been causing a lot of trouble for my friends..."
,"Now it's your turn to taste defeat!"
"#02653","All right...!"
,"Time for some chompin'!"
"#02654","Ah! So you're the savage band of pilots I've heard so much about?"
,"Hm? Pirates?"
,"Oh, that makes a lot more sense..."
"#02655","Ha ha ha!"
,"You think you have what it takes to survive in this dog-eat-dog world?"
"#02656","I've brought some of my strongest friends!"
,"You won't beat me this time!"
"#02657","Ha ha ha! You think you're so smart with your fancy ship and your weapons?"
,"Let's see if you can stand up to a real Viking!"
"#02658","Grrr!"
,"If you hurt my monsters, you hurt ME!"
,"Let's see how you like it!"
"#02659","Yo ho, matey! It's been decades since I started me search for the legendary treasure..."
,"I still haven't found it! But it wouldn't be legendary if ye could find it right away, would it?"
,"Do ye know anything about it? Ye do, don't you?! I'll be makin' ye talk!"
"#02660","Ho ho ho ho ho!"
,"Ho ho ho! You really think you can defeat ME?! Ho ho ho-- *wheeze* I'm laughing so much--"
,"I might not be able to fight...!"
"#02661","Pirates, eh?"
,"This is where your luck finally runs out!"
,"Give me your lives!"
"#02662","Ah, we meet again!"
,"That's right, I'm back! With a fresh cucumber and everything!"
,"It's time to show the world what a kappa can do!"
"#02663","I'm here on a quest for the lost city of gold..."
,"You think I'm just going to let a band of dirty pirates take it from me?"
,"Begone!"
"#02664","So you're the rookie pirates I've been hearing about."
,"Yeah, maybe I'll call you the ""latecomer rookies."" That has a nice ring to it."
,"Maybe it'll help you remember that I was here first!"
"#02665","Ha ha ha! I was called the strongest pirate in these seas since before ye was in diapers..."
,"And ye want to fight me?"
,"Go home to yer mommies!"
"#02666","Ho ho! You're the famous pirates that everyone's talking about?"
,"I hear you defeated my royal honor guard! ...Tall guys? ...Heavy armor?"
,"You mean you don't even remember?!"
,"Inconceivable! You'll pay for this!"
"#02667","Nice weather today, isn't it?"
,"In fact, it's the perfect weather for..."
,"A battle!"
"#02668","<co=ff0000>..."
,"Hey, how'd you see me? I'm a super stealthy ninja!"
,"Oh, well. Let's just fight then!"
"#02669","Blaaaaargh! Ugh... Blaaaaaaargh!"
,"Thank goodness you're here... Please... You have to help me..."
,"Put me out of my misery!"
,"If only I hadn't--blaaaaargh--eaten those mushrooms!"
,"Blaaaaargh!"
"#02670","Oho!"
,"I take it you're the pirates about whom I've heard so much."
,"I could tell by looking into your eyes... I can tell a lot of things from a man's eyes."
,"For example, your eyes tell me that you've been playing too many games..."
,"Impressive, no?"
,"This kind of insight is both a gift, and a curse."
"#02671","Well, hello!"
,"I was just looking for some capable bodyguards."
,"You interested? I only have one condition..."
,"You have to be stronger than me!"
"#02672","Oh, how do you do?"
,"Would you mind telling me how much it will take to buy that ship and crew from you?"
,"Money is no object."
,"No? ...I see. That's unfortunate."
,"If I can't have it, no one will!"
"#02673","Grr! Have you come for my head?"
,"Well, I'm still using it!"
"#02674","Ha ha ha! Taste the power of my ultimate punch!"
,"It'll send you to the ends of the earth!"
"#02675","Hello."
,"Thank you for using Bearington Corporation."
,"I've been visiting our pirate customers to check if their ships need any repairs."
,"What's that? You don't need any repairs?"
,"Then allow me to remedy that situation!"
,"Prepare for battle!"
"#02676","Hello. I'm something of a banana aficionado."
,"A real surprise for a chimp, I know."
,"It's my dream to take the bounties I get from defeating pirates and open a nice little banana farm."
,"So if it isn't too much trouble..."
,"I'll be collecting the bounty on your captain's head!"
"#02677","My goodness! Did you come all this way just to visit me?"
,"Well, then..."
,"I'd better give you a battle you won't forget!"
"#02678","Ahoy there!"
,"I guess we're both new to the pirate game, huh?"
,"How about we take turns? We'll pillage your ship this time, and you can do it next time! Honest!"
"#02679","Heh. Fortunetelling is a bit of a hobby of mine, so of course I knew you were coming."
,"I hired a sniper to run my cannon team, just for you."
,"Thanks to my fortunetelling, I even know your weaknesses! Yes, this will be fun..."
"#02680","Oh, dear... Yet another reckless band of pirates!"
,"You'll be the 100th ship I've sunk."
,"Isn't that an honor for you?"
"#02681","Oh, it looks like you're going to need a doctor!"
,"I'd be happy to help!"
,"It's the least I can do after I beat you black and blue!"
"#02682","Darn. I bet heavily that this ship wasn't going to get attacked."
,"*sigh* That's my 128th straight loss this year."
,"You're gonna have to pay me back..."
,"One way or the other!"
"#02683","It takes guts to face me..."
,"'Cause once I've got you in my sights, I'll take aim, light the fuse and..."
,"BAM!"
"#02684","Ha ha ha! Welcome, my little pirate buddies!"
,"I may be a thief, but I'm also the life of the party!"
,"So come on! Let's party!"
"#02685","An enemy ship!"
,"All hands on deck!"
"#02686","......<br>Quiet!"
,"I'm synthesizing a deadly poison! I need absolute quiet!"
,"Don't worry. When I'm finished, you'll be the first ones I test it on!"
"#02687","And a one, and a two! And turn!"
,"Pirates aren't scary at all if you're dancing!"
,"Come on, let's dance!"
"#02688","Bwa ha ha!"
,"People call me a cruel tyrant, but they're wrong! I'm a cruel and vicious tyrant!"
"#02689","Ho ho ho. Come, my pets..."
,"It's time for battle!"
"#02690","Hmph! You call yourselves pirates?! You're practically skin and bones!"
,"It's taken me many years and many buffets to build up this magnificent physique!"
,"Let's see if you're any match for it!"
"#02691","Ah, you're just in time."
,"I was just looking for someone who could challenge me in battle."
,"Let's go!"
"#02692","Yo ho ho ho!"
,"I hope ye don't think ye can survive a battle with me!"
"#02693","So you managed to defeat the rest of my fleet and make it all the way to me, did you?"
,"To tell you the truth, I'm a bit unnerved by that... But you won't beat me!"
,"*shake, shake...*"
"#02694","<co=ff0000>..."
,"If you won't turn back, you will die!"
"#02695","<co=ff0000>..."
,"Greetings from Ninja Village."
,"I forgot my throwing stars, so I'll fight with my sword!"
"#02696","Hello! I'm on a journey in search of a legendary dragon."
,"But as you might expect, legendary dragons aren't exactly the easiest things to find..."
,"I've been seasick the entire time, too. I had almost given up..."
,"But maybe if I capture some infamous pirates, I can still show my face back home!"
"#02697","Well, now. What country are you from?"
,"<team>?!"
,"How dare you show your faces around here! <team> is my mortal enemy!"
"#02698","So you managed to defeat the rest of my fleet and make it all the way to me, did you?"
,"I'm going to make this battle quick. This costume is hot and I'm dying for a drink!"
"#02699","You've come quite a ways to see me."
,"I can bench-press 3,000 pounds! Do you really think you can defeat me?"
,"Hm? You do? Huh... I really thought you'd be more impressed... Oh, well. Let's fight!"
"#02700","You think you have what it takes to beat me and my entire army?!"
,"...Wait, is this all we have left?!"
"#02701","Greetings!"
,"Since you've come all this way, I'll share a secret with you..."
,"I... Am your FATHER!"
,"Pretty shocking right?"
,"...Just kidding!"
"#02702","Ow! You're strong!"
"#02703","Hey, no fair! We lost!"
"#02704","Now I have a reason to be crabby!"
"#02705","Ouch! That hurt!"
"#02706","Ow! I'm sorry! I won't do it again!"
"#02707","Never mind! I don't want your stupid boat anyhow!"
"#02708","Whew... You really beat me?!"
"#02709","Owie! I think I broke something!"
"#02710","Ugh...!"
,"H-How is this possible...?"
,"Ugh...! I can't let it end this way..."
,"I'll have to use my time machine...!"
"#02711","Ouch! We're eely sorry!"
"#02712","That was a cheep shot!"
"#02713","That smarts! All I wanted was an autograph!"
"#02714","Hmph! You're lucky I was only fighting at 25% capacity!"
"#02715","Hey! I just wanted you to go away!"
"#02716","Eek! My fate is sealed!"
"#02717","Blaaah!"
"#02718","All hands! Abandon ship!"
"#02719","Hey, is that melted butter...?!"
"#02720","Nooo! My shell!"
"#02721","I'll be back after I complete my training..."
"#02722","Bouncy... *sniff* Bouncy..."
"#02723","I'm sorry my lord! I have failed you!"
"#02724","Ouch! That eely hurt!"
"#02725","Hmph! I'm going home!"
"#02726","How dare you do that to a person of royal blood?!"
"#02727","Nooo! My shell's all cracked!"
"#02728","Whew... I'm bone-tired!"
"#02729","""Super effective"" my foot!"
"#02730","Hisssss! You got me!"
"#02731","Losing is a real drag!"
"#02732","I AM... DEFEATED."
"#02733","YOU... WIN..."
"#02734","Ow... Maybe I wasn't cut out to be a pirate after all!"
"#02735","I SHOULD HAVE QUIT... WHILE I WAS A HEAD..."
"#02736","No... I have so many regrets..."
"#02737","Eek!"
"#02738","Meeee-ow!"
"#02739","D-Do you have any tape?"
"#02740","Meeee-ow-ow-ow!"
"#02741","Nooo! How is this possible?!"
"#02742","I-I lost?"
"#02743","Batteries...dying.<br>Power...failing.<br>Underwear...soiled."
,"...We will meet again."
"#02744","Ouch... You can't expect me to fight with a big crack in my torso!"
,"...We will meet again."
"#02745","Ouch... You can't expect me to fight with a big crack in my butt! (Heh...)"
,"...We will meet again."
"#02746","Ouch... You can't expect me to fight with a big crack in my chin!"
,"...We will meet again."
"#02747","Ouch... You can't expect me to fight with a big crack in my toenail!"
,"...We will meet again."
"#02748","Ouch... You can't expect me to fight with a big crack in my stomach!"
,"...We will meet again."
"#02749","Ouch... I jammed my finger. I can't possibly fight!"
,"...We will meet again."
"#02750","Ouch... You can't expect me to fight when I didn't get enough sleep last night!"
,"...We will meet again."
"#02751","Ouch... I think this is my limit."
"#02752","Agh! You got me!"
,"The boss isn't gonna like this!"
"#02753","Well, this day sucks!"
"#02754","OK, you win!"
"#02755","I guess I was weak after all!"
"#02756","Ow! You can't expect me to win fighting on a hill!"
"#02757","Waaah! Help me!"
"#02758","Oof! You...got me...!"
"#02759","Sorry! I'll never do it again!"
"#02760","Ouch, that smarts! I guess I wasn't ready after all!"
"#02761","Ack! I forgot to equip my equipment!"
"#02762","Argh! I lost!"
"#02763","Screeee!"
"#02764","Ugh. You win!"
"#02765","Hey! You're not one of my fans!"
"#02766","Hey! No fair! You can't get so close!"
"#02767","Aaagh! I wanna go back to the circus!"
"#02768","Ca-caw!<br>(""Now I'll never become a plush toy!"")"
"#02769","OK, so maybe it wasn't the best song in the world...!"
"#02770","Aaagh! Pay attention to your ship's construction! ...Aaah!"
"#02771","Oof! My training was obviously insufficient!"
"#02772","Eek! I'd say you stood up to my attacks just fine!"
"#02773","Darn! I should've used my old spear hold!"
"#02774","Nooo! Take good care of my fields!"
"#02775","Argh! I should've bought some decent weapons instead!"
"#02776","Huh? You mean I lost?"
"#02777","Hey! At least gimme back my box!"
"#02778","You cracked my head!"
"#02779","Why can't you just let me beat you?!"
"#02780","BAM! You got me..."
"#02781","I guess I'm number two...!"
"#02782","I guess this is the end of the line for me..."
"#02783","I hope there's room in your brig for me!"
"#02784","Hey! Nails aren't supposed to pound back!"

,"Oil get you for this!"
"#02796","OK, then... Would you trade them for this expired coupon?"
"#02797","YOU BEAT ME!"
"#02798","Back to the drawing board!"
"#02799","Please, no more!"
"#02800","Argh! We shouldn't have taken you all on at once!"
"#02801","I said to take it easy!"
"#02802","Burp! Why does my fire always come out too late?!"
"#02803","Ugh... I think I'm gonna retire!"
"#02804","But I'm your biggest fan!"

"#02816","Hey! Y-You put a big crack in my chin!"
"#02817","Wooooo! Don't tell anybody that I exist!"
"#02818","Ouch! See you in Beastie Bay!"
"#02819","OK! OK! So I bought the cakes for myself!"
"#02820","Oh, my ring was right here on my finger the whole time..."
"#02821","You're too strong! I'll have to revise my ad!"

"#02832","*rumble, rumble* We're cracking up!"
"#02833","*rumble, RUMBLE* Never mind!"
"#02834","Ouch! I never would have lost if this had been a dance battle!"
"#02835","Eek! I think I'll have to kiss that bonus goodbye!"
"#02836","Ow! One of my fishhooks is stuck in my hand!"
"#02837","Maybe I was a little too fast!"
"#02838","I knew I shoulda run!"
"#02839","Eek! The sniper has been sniped! Snooped? Snipped? Anyway, I lost!"
"#02840","I regret nothing!"
"#02841","What the--?!"
"#02842","Aaagh! You got me!"
"#02843","Wait! It's actually only been 245 years!"

"#02853","Ouch! I should've just fought on the hill!"
"#02854","I knew it!"
"#02855","Ow! I think I got the wrong guys!"
"#02856","Zzz... Hey, you got me while I was sleeping!"
"#02857","Ouch! I really did think we had a family resemblance!"
"#02858","Remember to use blacksmiths responsibly!"
"#02859","Ouch! I guess you were a little lamb instead!"
"#02860","Good luck hatching your eggs!"
"#02861","You made me forget my spell!"
"#02862","I guess this was an energy drink instead of poison... Ouch!"
"#02863","Ugh! Well, I did my best so I have no regrets!"
"#02864","Wait a minute! This spear is actually just a curtain rod!"
"#02865","Aha! Had enough?"
,"...Wait, I lost?"
"#02866","No! How could a genuine Viking be defeated?!"
"#02867","Aaagh! Take good care of your monsters!"
"#02868","Aaagh! Don't polluuuuute!"
"#02869","Aaagh! So this was my fate?!"
"#02870","Now watch me disappear!"
"#02871","Jump... Jump... *sniff*"
"#02872","I guess I'm ordinary after all!"
"#02873","Actually, you're pretty scary!"
"#02874","Now I'll never get to meet my favorite singer..."
,"Darn..."
"#02875","Nooooooo!"
,"You ripped my concert tickets!"
,"Darn..."
"#02876","Drip, drip, droop... I lost..."
"#02877","Agh! You beat me!"
"#02878","Aaagh! Maybe I needed more fertilizer!"
"#02879","Ow... Wait, I know! It's Milosoft!"
"#02880","I guess I just didn't want it bad enough..."
"#02881","Aaagh! We won't do it anymore!"
"#02882","Hey! You got me while I was distracted looking at your weapons!"
"#02883","S-So you're the strongest in the world, huh?"
"#02884","Oof! I'd better go back into training..."
"#02885","Ugh... So that's legendary power..."
"#02886","Crackle..."
"#02887","Hey, you pulped us instead!"
"#02888","I guess world domination will have to wait..."
"#02889","I challenge you to rematch! In about 10 years..."
"#02890","I'm sorry! Really I am!"
"#02891","You made a monkey out of me!"
"#02892","Just don't turn me in for my bounty, please!"
"#02893","Ugh... You beat me..."
"#02894","Ugh... I should've run away..."
"#02895","Darn... Should've used plan B..."
"#02896","Achoo! Maybe I gave you my cold, at least!"
"#02897","I'm sorry!"
"#02898","To tell you the truth, I wasn't even working on an invention!"
"#02899","Aw, but I really wanted that snack!"
"#02900","Eek! Real pirates are scary!"
"#02901","*yawn* See you later!"
"#02902","So much for my a-spear-ations of being a comedian!"
"#02903","So the legendary pirates..."
,"Have returned... No wonder I couldn't win..."
"#02904","Whew! This mask is so hot!"
"#02905","Ow! If only I'd gotten a decent night's sleep!"
"#02906","Crackle... Running low on power..."
"#02907","C-Call a doctor!"
"#02908","Ah! That was a blast!"
"#02909","HO HO... SORRY..."
"#02910","No! I bet everything on myself to win!"
"#02911","Yeah... I should've known I'd lose..."
"#02912","Darn you, Fluff...!"
"#02913","Burn... Burn... Fizzle..."
"#02914","Blast! I should've struck while you were weaker!"
"#02915","Hey! You didn't have to beat me so badly!"
"#02916","Hmph! I think I'll have to invest in a GPS..."
"#02917","Blech! So this is what defeat tastes like!"
"#02918","Hey! I lost a tooth!"
"#02919","I wish you really were pilots!"
"#02920","Eek! It looks like I'm the one getting eaten in this scenario!"
"#02921","Good help is hard to find..."
"#02922","Oops! Looks like you stood up to me just fine!"
"#02923","Take the monsters! Just leave me alone!"
"#02924","I guess I'll have to keep lookin'..."
"#02925","Ho ho ho! Hey, what am I laughing about?!"

"#02928","Erm, begone pretty please?"
"#02929","Beaten... By rookies...!"
"#02930","Mommy! They're bein' mean to me!"

"#02933","Y-You beat me!"
"#02934","Blaaaaargh!"
,"Thank... You..."
,"Darn those mushrooms!"
"#02935","You impudent wretches!"
"#02936","Y-You pass the test! Maybe I should go back into training..."
"#02937","Why couldn't you just have sold it to me?!"
"#02938","Darn..."
"#02939","Oof! My ultimate punch needs some work!"
"#02940","Ah! Thanks for using Bearington Corporation!"
"#02941","No! My precious bananas!"
"#02942","Hee hee! Toodle-oo!"
"#02943","OK! No more pillaging!"
"#02944","Ouch! How could my fortunetelling be so wrong?!"
"#02945","Now my ship is the one to sink! How ironic!"
"#02946","H-Help me!"
"#02947","Now I lost the battle AND my bet!"
"#02948","St-Stay away from me!"
"#02949","*sniff* Party's over!"
"#02950","Agh! Abandon ship!"
"#02951","Well, that could've gone better..."
"#02952","Take five, everybody!"

"#02954","Darn you!"

"#02957","I will have me revenge on ye!"

"#02960","Aaagh! I'm going back to Ninja Village!"

"#02962","<team>! I'll get you for this!"
"#02963","Hey, you ripped my costume!"
"#02964","I guess weightlifting and fighting aren't the same thing!"
"#02965","Y-You're just too strong for us!"
"#02966","OK, no more jokes!"
"#02967","It appears that we've arrived at a new island."
"#02968","Ich rieche Abenteuer!"
,"Oh, by the way. We got a postcard from the king. Here, let me read it..."
,"""Are you leaving some non-combat crewmates on your ship?"""
,"""The more crewmates you have on your ship, the easier everyone's lives will be, so be sure to have plenty!"""
,"It's nice that he's thinking of us, isn't it?"
,"Well, let's get on with this island's quests!"
"#02969","I smell adventure!"
,"By the way, I was doing a little light reading the other day and learned something about equipment."
,"It seems that some jobs <co=0066cc>have trouble using heavy equipment</co>, and compatibility can change equipment effects."
,"You might want to reevaluate your crew's equipment from time to time. Try using ""<co=0066cc>Suggest</co>"" if you're unsure!"
,"Well, let's get on with this island's quests!"
"#02970","Interesting... This island appears to be surrounded by high walls."
,"Better proceed with caution."
"#02971","And now that I get a good look at it, it seems that there are some vacant lots here."
,"If you <co=0066cc>have a trader aboard the ship</co>, the islanders will come to shop."
,"This can have a positive effect on the island. It may even increase the level of their houses."
,"Try ""<co=0066cc>Island Construction</co>"" as well as building on your ship to help them develop."
"#02972","I smell adventure!"
,"By the way, I was doing a little light reading the other day..."
,"And apparently crewmates can learn more skills by repeatedly changing jobs."
,"Just remember that you have to <co=0066cc>equip the skills</co> that they've learned for them to be effective."
,"Well, let's get on with this island's quests!"
"#02973","I smell adventure!"
,"By the way, have you given some of your crew <co=0066cc>ranged weapons </co>like bows or rifles?"
,"Crewmates in rear ranks can still attack if they have ranged weapons equipped."
,"If you find a weapon on a quest that can be repeated, you might try earning a number of them."
,"Well, let's get on with this island's quests!"
"#02974","I smell adventure!"
,"By the way, I talked to a representative from the Monster Hunting Committee recently."
,"According to him, monsters that your friends have defeated are added to your count."
,"So the more good friends you play with, the higher the target you can shoot for."
,"Well, let's get on with this island's quests!"
"#02975","It sure is hot around here..."
,"By the way, last night I had a dream about the importance of shields. ...What? Is that strange?"
,"Anyway, shields help you guard against attacks from things like rifles and bows."
,"Shields aren't easy to come by, but if you do find one don't forget to equip it."
,"...And I'll try to stop snoozing while I'm supposed to be on duty!"
,"Well, let's get on with this island's quests!"
"#02976","I smell adventure!"
,"By the way, did you know that each of your crewmates has a <co=0066cc>special ability</co>?"
,"No matter how often they change jobs, that ability will remain the same."
,"Some jobs, like joiner or wizard, have the same sort of special abilities that crewmates have."
,"It may be worth thinking about a crewmate's ability when deciding whether or not to recruit them."
,"Well, let's get on with this island's quests!"
"#02977","This island seems to have some vacant lots."
,"Select ""<co=0066cc>Island Construction</co>"" and contribute to the island's development."
"#02978","I smell adventure! Let's head on to the next quest!"
"#02979","I smell adventure!"
,"By the way, I was talking to a monster the other day..."
,"And he said that if you have a wizard you can <co=0066cc>take monsters with you on quests</co>!"
,"It might be worth trying to have one of your crew switch jobs to ""wizard."""
,"Well, let's get on with this island's quests!"
"#02980","I smell adventure!"
,"By the way, I've been meaning to talk to you about medals..."
,"You can earn medals a little at a time by getting a lot of friends and playing the game each day."
,"They're used for lots of different things, so you'll want to think carefully before using them!"
,"Well, let's get on with this island's quests!"
"#02981","I smell adventure!"
,"By the way, I heard a rumor about an item that lets you increase a crewmate's <co=0066cc>number of stars</co>."
,"The more stars they have, the more crewmates they can take along on quests..."
,"...and the <co=0066cc>more skills</co> they can equip. So they're very valuable in battle."
,"If you find a <co=0066cc>Skill Tonic</co>, be sure to use it on one of your best crewmates!"
,"Well, let's get on with this island's quests!"
"#02982","I smell adventure!"
,"By the way, I read an interesting article about the number of monsters you can have aboard your ship."
,"It seems that the larger your ship gets, the more monsters you can take on it."
,"So let's try and get a really big ship!"
,"Of course, to do that we're going to have to get some of these quests finished!"
"#02983","It appears that we've arrived at a new island."
,"This island seems to have some vacant lots."
,"Select ""<co=0066cc>Island Construction</co>"" and contribute to the island's development."
"#02984","My guidebook says that mermaids are sometimes spotted in this area!"
,"...There don't seem to be any around at the moment, though. So let's get started on a new quest!"
"#02985","Hmm... I can't help but think I saw a sinister shadow over there by those rocks..."
,"Oh, by the way, are you upgrading your armor at the blacksmith?"
,"Upgrading your weapons is very important, but make sure to upgrade your armor, too."
,"Then you'll be able to stand toe-to-toe with the strongest warriors in battle!"
,"Let's get on with this island's quests, but we'd better be careful!"
"#02986","An excellent choice! Thank you for your purchase!"
,"I'll unlock that command immediately."
,"You will now have another command on the team selection screen for quests or online battles."
,"Use it before heading off to battle!"
"#02987","Oho!"
,"I've been wanting to talk to you!"
,"You've really worked hard to raise the level of the monster farms around the world!"
,"We all got together and talked about the best way to thank you..."
,"So we baked you a cake!"
,"Unfortunately, a monster ate it yesterday..."
,"So instead of the cake, we've added the ability to <co=0066cc>upgrade Rank 2 monsters!"
,"This will allow you to make the most of your high-level monsters' abilities. Oh, don't forget to take a fortune on your way out!"
"#02988","Oh, I see you've purchased ""cheers."""
,"Well, now..."
,"You can now purchase something that's available to only a handful of pirates around the world."
,"Come any time you need an <co=0066cc>upgrade</co>."
"#02989","An excellent choice! Thank you for your purchase!"
,"From now on, you will be able to <co=ff0000>use battle cheers in quests</co> as well!"
,"The next time you play a quest battle, cheer mode will be on."
,"If you want to return to normal battle mode, just tap ""<co=0066cc>Cheering</co>"" on the menu."
